Mexico: Land of Impunity
                                        December 8, 2016
                                    The latest film from Al Jazeera’s Latin America Investigates series, Mexico: Land of Impunity, explores an apparent culture of impunity that allows some in Mexican law enforcement to detain and kill at will.Over the past decade Mexico has been beset by violence, as the state has battled drug cartels and criminal gangs for control of the streets. But critics say this endemic conflict has created a culture of impunity in law enforcement, with even ordinary citizens now routinely subjected to human rights abuses. So what lies behind Mexico’s troubled relationship with justice?In Mexico: Land of Impunity journalist and author Diego Osorno teamed up with filmmaker Luciano Gorriti to explore the role of the state in a country where authorities and criminals often appear to play by the same rules.Watch the film here: http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/latin-america-investigates/2016/12/mexico-land-impunity-161208072936383.htmlFurther further information contact: pressoffice@aljazeera.netRead moreultrajeremiahus liked this                                    awkwardblackhottie liked this                                    aljazeerapr posted this                                                                        FacebookTwitterAboutThe Public Relations team at Al Jazeera sharing what's new and exclusive.
