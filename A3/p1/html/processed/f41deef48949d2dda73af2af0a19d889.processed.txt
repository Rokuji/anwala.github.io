We have certain foreign powers arming terrorist groups inside that country and that has been aggravating the situation in the past years,” she added. “This is something that has to be addressed.”  When asked to respond to claims of Iran’s own role in the Syrian conflict through funding of the Bashar al-Assad government, Ebtekar responded, “These are certain allegations.”“The government of Iran does not agree with many of them,” she added.Ebtekar also commented on the horrific images of war that are coming out of East Aleppo.“I see those images, and they bother me,” she said.During the interview, Vice-President Ebtekar, who is also Head of Iran’s Environmental Protection Organization, spoke about her country’s fight against climate change. Ebtekar told ‘UpFront’ host Mehdi Hasan that this is one area that could bring Iran and the wider Middle East together.“I think that this is an important instrument for regional cooperation and working on this issue can help to bring about regional coalitions in a region which many of our relationships are politicized,” she said. “I think we need to work with not only our neighbors but with all countries, our Arab neighbors, because the environmental challenges we face, these are issues that we need to work together,” Ebtekar added.
