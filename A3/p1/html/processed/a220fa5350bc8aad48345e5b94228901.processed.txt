                                    101 East looks into the brutal
murder of activist Kem LeyReporter Mary Ann Jolley looks
at the possible motives and players behind Kem Ley’s violent death Doha - 10th
January, 2017.In July 2016, Kem
Ley, a popular social activist, radio commentator and frequent critic of the
Cambodian government was shot dead in broad daylight in a Phnom Penh petrol
station.Bystanders chased the suspected killer down
the road.  And when they caught up to him,
they hit and kicked him. He was only saved from a savage beating, or worse, by
police who took him away on their motorbike.On the day of Kem Ley’s funeral, tens of
thousands of people poured onto the streets to pay homage to one of Cambodia’s
favourite sons. Governments and human rights organisations
around the world called for a thorough and impartial investigation into his
murder. Kem Ley’s killing came after a string of
unsolved murders and attacks on activists and union officials. And in the lead
up to the national elections in 2018 things have been getting worse for those
daring to speak out against the status quo. Just a couple of days before he was gunned
down, Kem Ley had been on a radio show calling for an investigation into the
business interests of the family of Prime Minister Hun Sen. He talked about a
new report by Global Witness, which revealed the vast extent of the
family’s  financial reach.Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for 31 years, has
famously claimed his only source of income is his Prime Ministerial salary of
less than US$14,000 a year. Yet experts estimate his family’s combined wealth to
be between US$500 million and US$1 billion. The Global Witness report provides
details on family domestic companies worth US$200 million.Was Kem Ley killed because of his activism
and criticism of the government?  Or was
it, as his accused killer claimed, because of an unpaid debt?And who is this killer – a man who calls
himself Chuob Samlab , which in Khmer literally means “meet to kill”? 101 East embarks on an investigation into
Kem Ley’s murder.Reporter Mary Ann Jolley travels from London
to Paris, Phnom Penh to Bangkok, to piece together the details of the killing
and the arrested killer. She looks at the possible motives and players behind Kem
Ley’s violent death.Kem Ley is dead. But he has left behind a
legacy of Cambodians who will not be silenced.“I’m determined that I must
be strong. My husband once told me that in his absence, I should not cry, but
go on no matter what and I must stand up and challenge them.”Bou Rachana, Kem Ley’s
widow Ends: For more information please email pressoffice@aljazeera.net101 Eastal jazeera englishCambodiaRead moreanonymousspirits liked this                                    aljazeerapr posted this                                                                        FacebookTwitterAboutThe Public Relations team at Al Jazeera sharing what's new and exclusive.
