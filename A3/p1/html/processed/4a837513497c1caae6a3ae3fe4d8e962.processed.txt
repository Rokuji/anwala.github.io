Katrina vanden Heuvel, The Nation magazine editor and publisher, speaks about Obama’s legacy:·        Says Obama leaves us with “a deepening dangerous cold war and an escalating arms race”·        Says Obama has “passed on the baton of drone strikes, of special ops, of dangerous elements of U.S. foreign policy to a dangerous next president”(Washington, D.C. – 18th
January) - In an interview with Al Jazeera English’s current affairs show UpFront, Katrina
vanden Heuvel, editor and publisher of The Nation magazine,
speaks about U.S. President Barack Obama’s
foreign policy legacy.“I believe President Obama will leave us with
a deepening, dangerous cold war and an escalating arms race,” vanden
Heuvel told UpFront host Mehdi Hasan. “[Obama] in 2009 spoke of a world without
nuclear weapons,” she added. “Yet he leaves us with this one trillion dollar
modernisation of nukes.” Comparing the foreign policy legacy of
President Obama to former
President George W.
Bush, vanden Heuvel said it was, “More continuity than change in many regards.”“I think the president has passed on the
baton of drone strikes, of special ops, of dangerous elements of U.S. foreign policy to a dangerous next president,” she added. “That’s why a lot of progressives
called on President Obama to not re-litigate the past, but to hold accountable
elements of the George W. Bush administration.”
When asked what she thought of President
Obama’s overarching foreign policy dictum being “don’t do
stupid stuff”, she said, “I do think ‘don’t do
stupid stuff’ is not a bad one at this time. But unfortunately I think the
United States continues to do stupid stuff.” On the positive side, Katrina vanden Heuvel
highlighted the Iran deal and relations with Cuba, saying “I do think the Iran nuclear
deal was a major diplomatic gambit. It needs to be expanded. I think the
opening toward Cuba, normalization with Cuba, was vital.”Note to Editors·
