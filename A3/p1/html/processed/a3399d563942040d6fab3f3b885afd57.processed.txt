                                    Says those involved with Obama’s Syria policy “don’t look back
with any pride upon what Syria is today” Says authorizing
use of drones was one the most “difficult issues” Obama
had to faceExpresses concern over President-elect Donald Trump inheriting
Obama’s military
powers, including the expanded drone program: “It
worries me a lot”Washington, D.C. – 12th, January 2017 - In an interview with Al
Jazeera English’s current affairs show UpFront, Derek Chollet, former
assistant secretary of defense under
U.S. President Barack Obama,
speaks about the president’s legacy. “Those of us who were involved in the making
of Syria policy in the last five years don’t look with any pride upon what
Syria is today,” Chollet told UpFront host Mehdi Hasan. “There are many things, as I’ve looked back,
that the U.S. could have done differently,” he said.However, Chollet, who wrote
the book The Long Game: How Obama Defied Washington and Redefined America’s
Role in the World, did say that the administration’s biggest success on
Syria was reducing the
Assad government’s stockpile of chemical
weapons.“I think 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons out of Syria is good for the world,
good for us,” he said.On the subject of the Iran deal, Chollet
dismissed claims that the president crafted his Syria policies to accommodate the Iranian government and ensure the Iran deal
remains intact.“I don’t see that, in any way, connected
to any of the policy decisions on Syria,” he said.During the interview, Chollet was also asked
about President Obama’s use of drones.“No question that the use of drones has been
one of the more controversial and difficult issues that President Obama’s had
to face,” he said.“He’s used them quite effectively,” he added.When asked further if he was worried about
President-elect Donald Trump inheriting Obama’s military powers, including the
expanded drone program, he replied: “It worries me a lot.”Note to Editors·
