If the pop star isn’t touring the world, being a down-to-earth role model and a Vogue cover girl, and making music with industry greats, she’s perhaps happiest playing the domestic goddess at home, a notion highlighted by the sweet, intimate Instagrams she frequently posts from her kitchen or her living room.The T. Swift feed is chock-full of homebody favorites like freshly baked cookies and well-curated coffee tables. She also always has family and friends over for casual meals, Gigi Hadid and Hailee Steinfeld included. It’s nice to know that the hardest-working girl in pop music gets some chill time on her well-appointed couch and in her perfect kitchen, always with her beloved cats nearby. In fact, we can all take a page out of Swift’s book and learn to unwind a little in the comforts of our own home, even if it’s only for the cooking time allotted in one of Ina’s recipes.Below, take a look at the most charming snapshots from Taylor Swift’s cozy life at home.Loading
