                                    aljazeerapr:The renowned US academic, award-winning author and public
intellectual Professor Noam Chomsky, speaks with ‘UpFront’:Labels Donald Trump “an ignorant, thin-skinned megalomaniac”Says “the most predictable aspect of Trump is unpredictability”Says those who voted for third party candidate in the election
made “a bad mistake”Calls Trump’s positions on climate change a “radical setback”Slams the media’s coverage of the election: “The real treachery of
the media in this election was to avoid issues totally”(Washington, D.C. – 24th November) - In a wide-ranging
interview with Al Jazeera English’s current affairs show ‘UpFront’, Noam
Chomsky, spoke about the U.S. elections, Donald Trump and the media.“There’s never been anything like [Trump],” Chomsky told ‘UpFront’
host Mehdi Hasan. “In fact, the most predictable aspect of Trump is
unpredictability. I think it’s dangerous. Very dangerous.”“It’s certainly extremely hazardous to have an ignorant,
thin-skinned megalomaniac who sends off, you know, [tweets] at 3am if somebody
angered him,” he added.Asked about an interview in 2010 where he had warned that “frustration
and justified anger” in the US could lead the country down a road similar to
pre-war Germany, Chomsky said: “I wouldn’t compare it with Germany,” adding “Hitler
was a sincere, dedicated ideologue. Trump isn’t. He has no known ideology other
than ‘me’.”“He has no background at all in any political activities. Never
held office, been interested in office,” he added.“He’s basically a showman,”
Chomsky said of Trump, who “…strange background for a president.”On the subject of the media’s coverage of the election and Donald
Trump, Chomsky said, “The real treachery of the media in this election was to
avoid issues totally.”Chomsky was also asked about those who voted for third party
candidates Jill Stein and Gary Johnston instead of voting for Hillary Clinton.“I think they’re making a bad mistake,” he said.“Do you vote against the greater evil if you don’t happen to like
the other candidate? The answer to that is yes,” he added. “If you have any
moral understanding, you want to keep the greater evil out.”When asked about Trump’s position on climate change, Chomsky
called it a “radical setback.”“Trump’s position is more fossil fuels, eliminate regulations,
even coal, refuse the payments, promised payments to countries trying to move
to sustainable energy. To claim that this is the same as Clinton’s programs is
just madness in my view,” he said.Some on the left, like Slavoj Zizek, had claimed Trump’s election
victory would shake up the system and benefit the political left in the U.S.
Responding to that claim, Chomsky said, “It was the same point that people like
him said about Hitler in the early 30’s.”“He’ll shake up the system in bad ways,” he added. “That’s
completely regressive.”One positive aspect of Trump’s administration, Chomsky said, could
be easing tensions with Russia.“Anything that would reduce the growing and dangerous and severe
threat of nuclear war is to be welcomed,” he said. “It would be a nice thing if
humanity could survive.”Regarding claims by the U.S. government that Russia interfered in
the elections through hacking, Chomsky said, “It’s possible, but it’s a kind of
strange complaint in the United States. The U.S. has been interfering with, and
undermining, elections all over the world for decades and is proud of it.”- ends - Note to EditorsThis ‘UpFront’ interview with Noam Chomsky airs Friday
