                                    Ali Soufan says the Trump administration’s Muslim ban is couched in
“anti-Muslim sentiments”Proclaims that torture is “anti-American and will never happen”Warns that Trump’s travel ban “works directly” into ISIL’s propaganda
narrative(Washington, D.C. – 3rd, February) - In an interview with Al
Jazeera English’s current affairs show UpFront, Ali Soufan, a former FBI
agent and interrogator, said the Trump
administration’s decision to ban citizens
from seven Muslim majority countries from entering the United States “does not
help our national security interests”. Soufan
told UpFront host Mehdi Hasan, the ban
“actually works directly into Al Qaeda and the so-called Islamic State’s propaganda”.Asked
about the motives behind the implementation of the
ban, Soufan said, he believed “anti-Muslim sentiments” played
a role.“It
is very difficult to say that there is not an anti-Muslim sentiment in these
policies to cater to a specific base that they probably have in Washington,” he
said.  During the interview, Soufan — who has interrogated Al Qaeda members without the use of torture — reacted to President Donald Trump’s
pronouncement that torture was an effective tool in the fight against ISIL and
that the practice should be reimplemented.“We have so
many different investigations from the CIA, the FBI, the Department of Defense,
the Armed Services Committee, the Senate Select Committee of Intelligence and
we have a total agreement, it [torture] did
not prevent one single terrorist attack in the United States,” he said.Soufan
also pointed out that to bring back the practice, the president would need
Congress to overturn a law banning torture. “That
is so anti-American and it will never happen.”The full show will be available through this link: www.aljazeera.com/upfrontNote to Editors·
