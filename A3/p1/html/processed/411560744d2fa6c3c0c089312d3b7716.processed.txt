                                    New Al Jazeera report seeks to expose those
behind the vigilante death squads in the world’s most violent peacetime nationTeam behind award-winning Africa Investigates turns
its attention to Latin AmericaFirst episode investigates the links between
police, local businessmen and vigilante death squads in El Salvador“They carry out what the police can’t do
directly, which is take them (gang members) from their houses and kill them.”
Salvadorian journalist Brian Avelar24 November 2016 In a new series Latin America Investigates Salvadorian
web journalist, Brian Avelar travels
to the western province of San Miguel, where gang violence causes havoc and
devastation with an average of 16 homicides a day.   Avelar is a specialist in organised crime, and
in this investigation, the culmination of two years of research El Salvador: Assassins for Sale he sets
out to expose the businessmen and senior police officers implicated in the hiring
of professional killers to enforce the law.MS-13 is said to
have an estimated 60,000 gang members and claims to protect its own and look
after the disenfranchised.  But they rule
the community through terror and violence. 
Too scared to speak out because they fear for their own safety and the
safety of their family members. Avelar says that “people know what’s going on
but they’re afraid to talk, and even worse, they don’t want to talk to the
police.”One group, Los
Exterminos or The Exterminators first came to prominence last year when seven
bodies were found – each with bullet holes in their heads. And in this cycle of
violence, it appears that these hit squads have the public’s support because in
the absence of any effective state deterrent, these hitmen are fighting back
against the MS13 stronghold.A leaked classified
document seen by Avelar, gives an account of the formal investigation into the
group’s activities. It describes a group of heavily armed men operating from
several 4x4 vehicles, hunting down suspected gang members, allegedly being done
with the full knowledge of the overstretched Salvadorian police force.  It also says a number of local business men
are also under investigation for supplying weapons and vehicles.  According to Avelar there’s also evidence
that The Exterminators have a book or list, ‘All my sources confirm that the
information in the book comes from the police. 
Only the police have the names, photographs and details of the alleged
criminals.”Gang crime that
is difficult to control is extortion, and many small business owners are
threatened if they don’t pay the ‘rent’ demanded.  Will Sagado, former Mayor of San Miguel spent
two years in prison convicted of being a founder member of a death squad, Black
Shadow that operated in the 90s.  He
still denies this but explains, “We have to take the law into our own
hands. We’ve lost faith in the
authorities”.After much
negotiation, Avelar gets to meet with a heavily disguised member of MS-13 who
denies the gang extorts and claims they help people, “We don’t mess with
anybody. We lead our own lives.  Looking
after our territory, our families and the people living here.  The police and The Exterminators are carrying
out the killings.”  The
Exterminators also agreed for a spokesperson to be filmed, on the understanding
of strict anonymity.  He says of police
and army “they will never be able to truly protect our communities.  We have to defend ourselves.  They were taking everything from us….  We are few but we are winning the
battle. We will let the gang know that
poor people are not scared anymore.”  Finally, Avelar
also meets the highest ranking policeman, Inspector Malariaga, who is one of 20
policemen under investigation.  He shows
images of the gang’s violence on his cell phone to Avelar, which is too
shocking to be included in the film. “They cut people into little piece without
mercy… it doesn’t remotely touch their soul to take someone’s life away.” He
says he understands there are “honourable people who help protect, for example,
people from the countryside who are defenceless”, and that “Police might go
once or twice a month but these criminals live there. So that’s why these
people decide to take matters into their own hands.”  Yet he denies involvement with the hit squads
saying “I was unaware as to what they were doing”.  Of the 20 policemen
placed under investigation, fifteen of those are from the anti-extortion
department.  The Attorney General’s
office in San Salvador says it is investigating these claims but in the
meantime the murders go on - feeding the cycle of violence in which the lines
between criminality and the law are blurred out of all recognition.-
