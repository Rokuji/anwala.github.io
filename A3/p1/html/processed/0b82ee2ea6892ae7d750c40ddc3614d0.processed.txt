Operation Gaza

Two surgeons, 322km apart, attempt the first augmented reality surgery in the Middle East.
06 Jun 2016 13:54 GMT Health, Gaza, Middle East, Palestine

RenderPagesVideo('5030587033001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer');In war and disaster zones, a lack of specialist surgeons on the ground often means patients don't get the life-saving treatment they desperately need.
But advances in technology are allowing surgeons to communicate across international borders. This means they can share their skills with surgeons in areas which need them most.
Gaza has been the scene of conflict between Palestine and Israel for decades. The latest war in 2014 killed more than 2,200 people, the majority of them Palestinians.
After the war, 18-year-old Fadel was seriously injured, when an unexploded ordnance went off in his hand.
Join Dr Javid Abdelmoneim in Gaza to follow an extraordinary surgery using augmented reality technology.
The technology enables a surgeon in Lebanon to lend his expertise and provide guidance to a life-changing operation in Gaza. 
Editor's note: 
Operation Gaza’ has won the FPA Award for Science Story of the Year for 2016Source: Al Jazeera
