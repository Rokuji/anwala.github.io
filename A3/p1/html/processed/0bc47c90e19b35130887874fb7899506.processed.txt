                                    Senior Hamas leader speaks to Al Jazeera on moving the US embassy to JerusalemReveals Hamas will be releasing a new
charter “very soon” that addresses anti-Semitic statements in their 1988
original charter Says it’s “inaccurate” to suggest Hamas
supports a two-state solution, but says they support a “Palestinian state on the
lines of 4th of June 67, including the right of return and Jerusalem
as a capital”Supports the newly announced unity
government with rival faction Fatah: “The international community will not
support us unless we’re united”Warns U.S. President Donald Trump not to
add “more oil to the fire” by moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv
to Jerusalem. (Washington,
D.C. – 25th, January) -  In an
interview with Al Jazeera English’s current affairs show UpFront, Osama Hamdan, a senior leader of Hamas, revealed that the group is
working on a new charter which includes addressing
widely criticised anti-Semitic statements in
the [1988] original.  “We
will have a clear political document, which is supposed to be in the near
future, clarifying all those points,” Hamadan told UpFront
host Mehdi Hasan, referring to anti-Semitic conspiratorial
claims in the Hamas charter accusing Jews of
running the world,
creating communism and starting World War One and Two. “You will find in this document
clear words that we against the Zionists, against the occupation of our lands
and we will resist the occupiers, whoever they were. And we are not against
anyone regarding to this religion or to his race,” Hamdan said. When asked about a
timeframe for the new charter, Hamdan said it would be released “very soon”.Hamdan also commented
on his organisation’s current stance on a two-state solution with
Israel. “We want to build a Palestinian state on the lines of
the 4th of June 67, including Jerusalem, with the right of return
for Palestinians,” he said, referring to the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip. However, when pressed
to further clarify if that meant Hamas supports a
two-state solution, Hamdan said that “would be
inaccurate”. “You can call it
whatever you want, but this is what we accept. Nothing more than this, nothing
less than this,” he added.On the issue of the
newly announced unity government with rival Palestinian group Fatah, Hamdan
offered his full support. “We need… a national unity government,” he said. “Israelis now are taking over the land
by the settlements. The region is unstable.” “The international
community is not willing to help the Palestinians unless they are united,”
he added.  During the interview,
Hamdan was also asked how he believes new U.S. President Donald Trump’s support
of Israel and plans to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem might
impact the region.“[Trump] has
to make a choice whether he wants to create peace in the region or he wants to
add more oil on the
fire,” he said. “Palestinians will
not accept to abandon Jerusalem, they will not accept to abandon their rights,” he added.  Asked whether or not the embassy moving to Jerusalem would lead to renewed
violence, Hamdan said: “I don’t accept the idea of having violence from the
Palestinian side.”“Now if there was
changes or the United States administration try to make a change in the status
of Jerusalem, of course that will mean an action from the Palestinian side and
no one can control that,” he added.  He also defended his
organisation’s past use of suicide attacks across the Green Line, against
Israeli targets, asking, “What’s the problem in that: the bombs or the suicide
actions?” – He made a comparison with Israeli rockets against Palestinian homes
and markets. “As Palestinians we
don’t have…  tanks…so we use what we have,” he added.  ###Note
