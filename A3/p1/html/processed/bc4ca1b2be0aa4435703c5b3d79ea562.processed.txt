                                    Croatian
philosopher Srećko Horvat will look behind the refugee flows, terror attacks,
and Brexit to reveal what is really threatening Europe’s establishment.Episode one titled “The Business of Colonisation” to air on February
19th will explore the
colonial methods of extraction European nations once elsewhere are now being
practised on Europe itself.Episode two titled “The Colonised Society” which will air on
February 26th will examine how this colonisation is affecting the
politics of Europe with frightening reactions which include terrorism and the
rise of the far right Doha – 26th January, 2017From France’s Front
Nationale, to neo-fascists Jobbik in Hungary and the looming Brexit, Europe’s disgruntled voters are turning to an anti-elitist
populism that is challenging mainstream politics. With French and German
elections due in 2017,there are fears centrist parties will lose more ground,
but few can explain why. In
this new two part documentary series, Croatian philosopher Srećko Horvat looks
behind the refugee flows, terror attacks, and Brexit to reveal what is really
threatening Europe’s establishment.“Often
these phenomena are discussed as if they are forces of nature beyond our control”
says Srećko. “But as a philosopher I look for the root causes. What if the
economic collapse, refugees and terrorism are actually all caused by something
more fundamental?”Starting
in Idomeni, where the refugees crossed from Greece to Macedonia, Srećko goes on
a pan-European odyssey that takes in the Port of Piraeus, Romanian Forests,
Welsh valleys, the offices of far right parties, the channel tunnel and the
European Parliament. In the first episode, The Business of Colonisation, Srećko finds evidence that the colonial methods of extraction and
democratic suppression that European nations once applied to much of the Middle
East and Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries are now
being practised on Europe itself. In an exclusive
revelation, former Greek Finance Minister Yanis
Varoufakis tells Al Jazeera how this undemocratic colonial control was used
recently to prevent Greece recovering from its debt crisis. As part of its bail
out by the Troika of the European Central bank, European Commission and
International Monetary Fund, Greece was forced to sell the strategic Port of
Pireaus. Varoufakis tells Srećko how he
negotiated a deal with the Chinese that would guarantee jobs, investment and
union recognition, while the Chinese government would buy enough Greek
government bonds for them to return to international money markets. “And guess what happened,”
says Varoufakis, “there was a telephone call from Berlin to Beijing saying keep
off Greece while we are negotiating with them and all deals were off because,
of course, China is not going to jeopardise its relationship with the heart of
Europe in order to seal a deal with us.”The
second episode, The Colonised Society, Srećko
looks at how the people of Europe are responding. “The
major decisions that determine how life is lived are made without popular
participation and that causes anger, frustration and contempt for the
parliamentary system”, says Professor Noam
Chomsky “And it leads to erratic and often frightening reactions.” Srećko examines how
those frightening reactions include terrorism and the rise of the far right, on
trips to Molenbeek in Brussels and to meet Hungarian nationalist party Jobbick
in Budapest. But the anger and frustration at colonisation has also taken a
different route, as Srećko finds out in visits to French protest camps, Greek
markets, German energy grids, and the City of Barcelona. Across
two 48 minute episodes, Srećko talks to Welsh steel workers, French protesters,
Hungarian philosopher Agnes Heller, MEP Nigel Farage,
professor Noam Chomsky, philosopher
Slavoj Zizek, Socioloigist Saskia Sassen, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange,  and the mayor of Barcelona Ada Colau. Srećko’s journey across Europe is deadly serious,
and his analysis urgent, but the films are also lifted by the irrepressible
charm and humour of one of Europe’s leading young thinkers. Ends:Europe’s
