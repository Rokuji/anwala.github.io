International Women's Day 2018 campaign theme: #PressforProgress
With the World Economic Forum's 2017 Global 
        Gender Gap Report findings telling us that gender parity is over 200 years away - there has never been a more important time to keep motivated 
        and #PressforProgress. And with global activism for women's equality fuelled by movements like 
        #MeToo, #TimesUp 
        and more - there is a strong global momentum striving for gender parity.
And while we know that gender parity won't happen overnight, the good news is that across the world women are making positive gains 
        day by day. Plus, there's indeed a very strong and growing global movement of advocacy, activism and support.
So we can't be complacent. Now, more than ever, there's a strong call-to-action to press forward and progress gender parity. A strong 
        call to #PressforProgress. A strong call to motivate and unite friends, colleagues and whole communities to think, 
        act and be gender inclusive.
International Women's Day is not country, group or organisation specific. The day belongs to all groups collectively everywhere. So 
        together, let's all be tenacious in accelerating gender parity. Collectively, let's all Press for Progress.

#PressforProgress NOW


Collectively we can all play a part
Collective action and shared responsibility for driving gender parity is what makes International Women's Day successful. 
        Gloria Steinem, world-renowned feminist, journalist and activist 
        once explained 
        "The story of women's struggle for equality belongs to no single feminist nor to any one organisation but to the collective 
        efforts of all who care about human rights." 
Started by the Suffragettes in the early 1900's, the first International Women's Day was celebrated in 1911. International 
        Women's Day belongs to all communities everywhere - governments, companies, charities, educational institutions, networks, 
        associations, the media and more. Whether through a global conference, community gathering, classroom lesson or dinner table 
        conversation - everyone can play a purposeful part in pressing for gender parity.
So make International Women's Day YOUR day and do what you can to truly make a positive difference for 
            women. Press for Progress!

2017 IWD campaign theme was #BeBoldforChange
For International Women's Day 2017 and beyond, individuals and organisations were encouraged to 
        #BeBoldforChange by taking ground breaking action that truly drives the 
        greatest change for women. Many influencers around the world committed to bold 
        action to accelerate gender parity, acknowledging their responsibility to do what they can to forge 
        a more gender inclusive world. Have you submitted your #BeBoldforChange 
        action yet?
Back in 2016, organisations and individuals around the world were invited 
        to support the #PledgeforParity campaign and commit to helping women and 
        girls achieve their ambitions; challenge conscious and unconscious bias; call for gender-balanced 
        leadership; value women and men's contributions equally; and create inclusive flexible cultures. From 
        awareness raising to concrete action, organisations 
        rallied their people to pledge support 
        to help forge gender parity on International Women’s Day (IWD) and beyond.
Each one of us - with women, men and non-binary people joining forces - can be a leader within our own 
        spheres of influence by taking bold pragmatic action to accelerate gender parity. Through purposeful 
        collaboration, we can help women advance and unleash the limitless potential offered to economies the 
        world over. We have urgent work to do - together!

International Women's Day (March 8) is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. The 
                            day also marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity. International Women's Day (IWD) has occurred for well over a century, with the 
                            first​ ​March 8​ ​IWD gathering supported by over a million people in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. Prior to this the​ Socialist Party 
                            of America, United Kingdom's Suffragists and Suffragettes, and further groups campaigned for women equality. Today, IWD belongs to all groups 
                            collectively everywhere. IWD is not country, group or organisation specific.​ Make IWD your day! - everyday!
