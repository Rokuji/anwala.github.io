                                    Guy Verhofstadt MEP, the European Parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator,
speaks with UpFront:Says a ‘Little Englander’
mentality could be a “good explanation” for why Brits voted for BrexitDeclares it “technically
impossible” for the UK to have a new trade deal in place with the EU in two years’
time Suggests it’s “always
possible” that the UK might rejoin the EU in the future and it could be a
“little bit faster a process”Describes Brexit and other
political challenges to the EU - from Trump to Putin - as an “existential
threat”(Washington, D.C. – 27th, January) - In an interview with Al
Jazeera English’s current affairs show, UpFront, Guy Verhofstadt, the
European Parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator, speaks about Brexit, Britain and
the challenges facing the European Union (EU). Asked about which issue drove 52% of Britons to vote for Brexit in
June 2016, Verhofstadt replied: “Mainly the migration. It’s very clear.”When asked by UpFront host Mehdi Hasan if
xenophobia and specifically a Little
Englander mentality explained the Brexit vote, the MEP and former Belgian
prime minister responded, “That’s maybe a good explanation”.During the interview, Verhofstadt was also asked whether it would
be possible for the UK government to negotiate both Brexit and a new trade deal with the EU by 2019. “That’s technically impossible,” he said, referring to the
timeline on a future trade agreement.He also emphasized that whilst they are not looking for a punitive
exercise, the EU parliament will want a fair and generous agreement, where “you
can never have outside the European Union a better status than as member of the
European Union”.Verhofstadt also gave his thoughts on whether the UK could
potentially re-enter the EU in the future under a different government. “That
is always possible,” he said. “They can always reintroduce a request for
membership of the European Union.”“Certainly, we have enough experience to make it a little bit a faster
process than what is normal,” he added.The senior MEP and former Belgian prime minister also agreed that
the numerous challenges facing the EU - the election of Donald Trump, the rise
of Putin’s Russia, Brexit, and the fiscal and refugee crises - constitute an
“existential threat” to the future of the union. Note to Editors·
