These Kids Had To Find Their Moms Without Seeing Them... And It's Beautiful

This is so sweet.

Pandora Jewelry released "The Unique Connection," an unexpectedly heartwarming video in which a group of children, aged three to nine, and their moms participated in a simple experiment.





Each child was blindfolded and guided towards the group of mothers.








www.youtube.com






One by one, the children made their way across the group of moms.They searched expectantly, looking for familiarity in shirts and hands and faces...







www.youtube.com







And each eventually found the one that they knew as mom.








www.youtube.com






The video serves as a beautiful reminder of the special bond we share with our mothers. It's like nothing else.
